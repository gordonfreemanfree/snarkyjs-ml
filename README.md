# snarkyjs-ml
This project provides a proof of concept for using machine learning models with zero-knowledge proofs. It demonstrates the use of zk-SNARKs in a machine learning context by implementing a neural network for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. This neural network was completely implemented in zk-SNARK circuits using the SnarkyJS library. By using zk-SNARKs in this way, the prover can prove that they have drawn a certain handwritten image, which was then recognized by the neural network, without revealing the actual image itself. This could have potential applications in scenarios where privacy and security are important, such as proving that one is older than a certain age by presenting a photo of their passport without revealing sensitive personal information.
